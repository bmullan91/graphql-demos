# GraphQL Demos

Hi ðŸ‘‹. This repo contains 3 graphql demos, structured as challenges. For each demo, read it's README to guide you on how to get started. If you need some clues, you can peek at the [solutions](https://github.com/bmullan91/graphql-demos/tree/master/solutions).

## Prerequisites

- node `v6.x.x` or greater. I find [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) the best way to switch between versions.
